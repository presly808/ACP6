2. Implement asynchronous chat that allows communication with two and more users  !!!!!Developing chat use Git!!!!!!
    Must have
    - (saving history of messages into the file)
    - read connections setting(port, max users size, list of banned users)
        from server_settings.properties (see class Properties)
    - send message using Serialization (ObjectOutputStream, ObjectInputStream)
    - for better architecture of application see pattern Observer
    - * write UI based on Swing
